In this Game, you can play against an opponent that uses a min max algorithm. The program is simply written in C and was for a Coding Competition in APS105 at UofT. The algorithm is hard to beat and came in 2nd place. <img width="283" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/039e0010-05fe-4e93-a73e-7c6c940dfca3" />
